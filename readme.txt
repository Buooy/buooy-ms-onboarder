== Description ==

Looking for an easy way to help onboard new users? Buooy Multisite Onboarder is a great way to help new users set important site/blog information. 

Simply activate the plugin on a network level and every new site will have the onboarding modal launched. If you need to launch the modal at anytime again, just append *"?onboarding=start"* to your url in the admin.

These are the current settings that your new users can set - [Screenshots](screenshots/):
